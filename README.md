# MixCOATL

Non-standard analysis tasks and scripts for processing LSST Camera images taken in the Bench for Optical Testing (BOT) during the integration and testing period. The Mixed Calibration Optics Analysis Test Library, or MixCOATL module was developed to perform the following analysis tasks:

* Measurement of electronic crosstalk using a number of methodologies.
* Organization of electronic crosstalk results within an SQL database framework.
* Handling of source catalogs generated for BOT images taken using a "fake star field".

## Dependencies

The MixCOATL module is being developed concurrently to use the latest version of the LSST Science Pipeline DM Stack, and should require no additional dependencies beyond what is included in this software stack.
